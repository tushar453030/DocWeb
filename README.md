# DocWeb
A Portfolio website hosted by making the image in the docker container and then host it on Heroku.


This project is based on Containerization of applications.In our project we created a web Portfolio using python,HTML and CSS. Containers are small computation units that are light weight, fast to deploy over servers within seconds. When you run an application on the container at the time of production user need to make an image of the container running the application and then that image is deployed directly to the servers with all neccessaries dependencies attached within the image only.

We start by making the requirements.txt file by running the lower command.
```pip freeze > requirements.txt```
